#this is the minimum-cut problem, with the advantage that we are given the size of the cut (3)
# which is often the hardest part (determining if the cut is minimal)

# IIRC, this is Karger's algorithm - which is probabalistic but since we *know* the cut size we can make it deterministic by repeating until k = 3
