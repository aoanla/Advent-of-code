This is a simple repo to collect my Advent Of Code submissions, starting with 2023.

I'm probably not going to get much past Day 10, the traditional point at which it gets hard and people have other things to deal with in their lives, but this is also an excuse to write more Julia and more Rust so...

Evolving plan is:
1. Solve Part 1 and Part 2 for a day in Julia
2. Solve Part 2 (at least) for the day in Rust
3. If I am feeling up to it, solve Part 1 for the day in Uiua [so far only for Day 4]
